*** IMPORTANT ***
Untold Stories was previously known as "Underground Missions". If you installed the previous mod, you need to uninstall it.  To do so, simply delete the UndergroundMissions directory from \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\ located in the root of your The Secret World directory.

*** How to install ***

Unpack the Untold directory into \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\ located in the root of your The Secret World directory, so it looks like this:

\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Untold\Untold.swf
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Untold\CharPrefs.xml
\Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Untold\Modules.xml

PLEASE NOTE: Make sure you restart your client after installing this add-on. Always restart your client when adding XML files as these only get read on load.

Start a mission by selecting Underground Missions from the TSW menu.

*** How to uninstall ***

Simply delete the Untold directory from \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\.

*** About Untold Stories ***

Untold Stories of The Secret World is a MOD that allows you to write your own missions for The Secret World. I have written three missions that demonstrate the foundation of the system and the features that are available. My hope is that this will spark interest in the community and expand over time. The three included missions are:

 - Basic Training: A simple mission for demonstrating and testing the basic features of the system.
 - A Personal Matter: The Stationmaster has a personal request for you. This is an action mission with some light investigation elements.
 - The Scroll: A mysterious scroll has been discovered in the desert. This is a full investigation mission that will test your knowledge of The Secret World. Now with cinematics!

You can create missions now using XML files. Documentation is included in \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\Untold\Untold_Docs.pdf.

Untold Stories Lore highlights fan fiction, art, music, and video creations from the TSW community.  When you are near a designated location or character, a red US icon will appear in the notification area. Click the icon to open the lore.

Please provide feedback in the TSW Forums (http://forums.thesecretworld.com/showthread.php?t=82855). IF YOU NEED MISSION HINTS, PLEASE USE SPOILER TAGS. I look forward to your thoughts.

Thanks,
